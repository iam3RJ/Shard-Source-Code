:dad:So you finally decided to show your face.
:bf:Well I would've been here a few seconds sooner, but I had to rid us of any potential distractions.
:dad:Distractions you say?
:bf:Yeah. There were two kids who almost wandered in here. I simply warped them to the other side of the planet.
:dad:You and your concern for mortals angers me. No matter. You should know why I'm here.
:bf:Yeah I sure do. I also know that you have some nerve showing your face here in my universe.
:dad:This universe will soon cease to exist. Your death is something I will see through to the end.
:bf:Then enough small talk. Let us begin.
