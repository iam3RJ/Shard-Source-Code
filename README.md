# shard-source-code
This is the source code for my VS Shard mod. This contains all the code for the new Full Experience update, 
and also has a bunch of unused assets that have existed since the mod was first created back in April. If you use anything
from this mod for your own, all I ask is for you to credit me somewhere in your code.
